Island is populated by rabbits, foxes, and vegetation. It is split into 64 squares.

Population of rabbits & foxes depends on several factors:
	1. # of rabbits & foxes in a square at start of day.
	2. the reproduction rate of rabbits & foxes
	3. the vegetation growth rate.
	4. the death rate of "old" rabbits and foxes.
	5. the eating habits of foxes (rabbits are hard to find in dense vegetation)
	6. the eating habits of rabbits (vegetation can only support so many rabbits)
	7. the migration of rabbits (square to square) & foxes (2 blocks)

Rabbit Rules:

	1. A birthing date occurs every 9 weeks.
	2. For each pair of rabbits in a square, a litter is born.
	3. A litter ranges from 2-9 rabbits. Based on # of rabbits & vegetation. [table 6.1]

Fox Rules
	1. A birthing date occurs every 6 months.
	2. For each pair of rabbits in a square, a litter is born.
	3. A litter ranges from 0-5 foxes. Based on # of foxes & per-fox rabbit population. [table 6.2]
